## IMDb CSV Ratings to JSON in the browser

This is a NextJS implementation of this simple python [script](https://github.com/fjbarrett/imdb-ratings-to-json) designed to strip down the IMDb ratings available as an exported .csv file from an imdb.com user account.

## Purpose

The purpose of this tool is to create a consolidated list of user ratings and make them portable to chat.openai.com. Currently, copying and pasting the entire .csv from IMDb is not possible with a substantial amount of ratings.

## Live view

Project is available to use online.
